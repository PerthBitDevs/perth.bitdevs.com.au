#  Perth Bitdevs

Perth Bitdevs is held on the first Thursday of every month at the **Phat Brew Brewing Co** in City West at 6PM.

This is a socratic style seminar with Chatam House Rules. 

As a group, we discuss the latest Bitcoin news from a technical perspective. Sometimes diverging into adjacent fields of privacy, self hosting, free software, and more! 

Whilst the topics are often technical in nature the goal of the group is to explore and explain the topics so please don't be intimidated and give it a go!

**[Join the telegram](https://t.me/bitcoin_perth) to join the Bitcoin Perth group, confirm event details - and say hello!**

## News items for this month

Please suggest any noteworthy topics for next month in the [GitHub issue]([https://github.com/PerthBitDevs/PerthBitDevs/issues](https://github.com/PerthBitDevs/PerthBitDevs/issues))! We're open to discussing pretty much anything Bitcoin or Bitcoin-adjacent!

## Things to note

Attendence is often larger than meetup page RSVPs.

This event is not streamed online, to preserve free discussion, atmosphere, engagement, and community. There are no photos allowed unless previously agreed with everyone in the photo. 

To facillitate optimal free and open discussion, privacy of attendees is taken seriously, absolutely no photos/recordings without explicit consent from all parties. [Chatham house rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule) applies.

## Group Activities

We aim to occasionally try new software or tutorials as a group, building applicable skills within a supportive group environment. It may be useful to bring a laptop machine along with you! MacOS or Linux preferred (for windows [you could use a virtual machine](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-linux-windows-vmware-virtual-machine/)).
